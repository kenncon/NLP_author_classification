Bouck,"So my take is this...

This album was never going to make me happy because of how important TGG was to my wife and me, so I purposely gave it a ton of leeway. When Cardinals was first released I was pretty stoked, but the artwork left me kind of “meh” because I’m such a James Heimer fan. Cigarettes &amp; Saints was pretty amazing, but Thanks For The Ride instantly discouraged me.

Upon first listen of the album I found myself gravitating toward the first half (Brothers &amp;, Cardinals, A Song for Patsy Cline, Cigarettes &amp; Saints) and that was pretty much it. The other songs just never did anything for me. But I kept listening anyway because it’s TWY and I’ll be damned if I don’t give it every possible chance. After about a month I realized I stopped listening to the first half and started listening to everything else. All of the sudden I didn’t really care about those song and all I could listen to was I Don’t Like Who I Was Then, The Bluest Things On Earth, A Song For Ernest Hemingway, Stained Glass Ceilings, I Wanted So Badly to Be Brave, Palm Reader, You in January, and No Closer to Heaven. And I LOVE that closer now. That song is an absolute diamond in the rough (the rough being their entire discography, not the album itself). 

All of the songs helped me finally appreciate and understand the artwork. Once I finally understood it all, it was tremendously easier to enjoy. I even really loved the tour art that went with it. Everybody should check out Mike Cortada because he is a hell of an artist.

I also loved the MCS split. It really allowed me to appreciate Cardinals in a new way.

I would say that the album definitely had an unfair start after following the Upsides/Suburbia/TGG trilogy and it was even less advantageous to specifically follow TGG. But once I gave it its due and really took it all in I realized how easy it was to miss this gem. I’m glad I let it take hold. This album marked a ton of new directions for the band. Different art, lyrical themes, music, pace, etc. But I think it really hit the mark.

My only complaints are the following.    
1.	I can’t stand Thanks For The Ride. I don’t know why, but I just hate this song.
2.	I can’t stand JAB on Stained Glass Ceilings, but the song is so good that I let it go.
3.	I can’t stand hearing my wife complain that I don’t care about Cigarettes &amp; Saints anymore. I’m not saying it’s a bad song at all. But there are some seriously better songs on the album and they get my attention first.
4.	It drives me crazy that the lyrics have a misprint in the jacket of every single vinyl copy. My OCD can’t take it.
5.	I can’t stand the bitching about the mix.

The mix bitching is the biggest complaint I have. The band has even commented about their distaste for it. I just don’t understand. My ears must be terrible because I just don’t have an issue with it. I can definitely hear the difference, but I feel like it is exactly how it should be for this album. It just feels and sounds right to me. Everyone is allowed to have their opinion and I’m not saying anyone else is wrong, I just don’t have an issue with it. I don’t think it would work for any of their other works, but I feel like it’s perfect for NCTH.",1567702155,1,TheWonderYearsMusic

Agree:     
1.	It better not be a shirt.
2.	They better start doing some different shit.
3.	Probably not subscribing next year either.
4.	It very much feels like they don’t know what they are sending.
5.	It pisses me off about them asking all these questions for nothing. This is in context to your shoe size comment. Shoes will never be in the box. They cost way more than $20 which knocks them out. Plus they would charge and arm, leg, and one of your feet for you to eat the shipping. At best it would be cheap ass flip flops or socks. What super pisses me off though was them asking for all of the allergens and then sending a food item without any listed ingredients of allergen warnings.

Disagree:    
1.	The letter wasn’t enough justification for ANY of this. 
2.	They know what they are sending ahead of time because of the lead time these things require (which makes it more infuriating).
3.	Receiving it at any point in the month doesn’t bother me. Most buyer protection policies protect buyers up to 90 days after purchase, some even 180. But it better show up in the damn month it is intended for. 
4.	You will probably never see a hoodie or sweatpants. The cost of a hoodie (even at 1,000+ units) exceeds the $20 by a bit. 
5.	If they send me a towel I think I would snap more than the shirt. I have house towels. And it’s way too late for a beach towel (of which I already have several anyway).",1569069173,7,TheWonderYearsMusic

I have significantly more tattoos than everyone who went out when we were all 18 and I’m the only one who doesn’t have a tattoo I regret. Tattoos I got over 10+ years ago still resonate with me despite all of the life lived over those years.

Bouck,"I’m going to be posting throughout the month as I have a lot of tips. My first tip is to make sellers grade what they have, send photos before buying, and use PayPal (specifically the Goods &amp; Services function) to purchase.    

Discogs makes grading easier as pretty much all “for sale” items are graded (both jacket and platter). However, Discogs doesn’t allow sellers to post photos. I always ask sellers to send me photos via email or imgur and then save those photos. This way if you ever have to dispute a sale you have evidence of what was advertised vs. what you received. This is a huge help.

However, always ask a seller to grade their item. I always recommend [The Goldmine Standard found here](https://www.goldminemag.com/collector-resources/record-grading-101). Have the seller grade both the jacket and the platter. Why is this important? Because PayPal has buyer protection. If you paid using PayPal’s “Goods &amp; Services” options then you are protected if what you received is “significantly not as described.” By having the seller grade everything (and saving that information) you can prove to PayPal that something very specific was advertised and expected on your part as it was clearly advertised by the seller. It makes it easy as hell to prove that what you received wasn’t what was supposed to be received. PayPal will take your side and you can buy knowing that you have that safety net.

Awhile back (prior to knowing what I know now about TWY vinyl) I had a seller sell me one of the Translucent Orange manufacturer variations of the red first press of The Greatest Generation. The seller insisted that the platter was in NM- shape. I inquired about it relaying what I knew about the quality issues and that it was completely impossible for it to be NM- shape. They insisted so I bit. I put it on the turntable and sure-as-shit it skipped in the first couple bars of There, There. It actually skipped throughout the record as well. I would have given the seller a pass if the issue were the standard issue know for that copy, but skipping wouldn’t fly. PayPal had my back as I was able to clearly show the grading vs. what I ended up receiving.

So whether you use Discogs, eBay, Depop, or a private sale. Always use PayPal (Goods &amp; Services), always have the seller grade what they are selling, and try your best to get photos of anything grading less than NM/NM-.",1567367132,3,TheWonderYearsVinyl

What if instead of a bowl, it’s the fountain. Lyric would read “I felt something in me change.”

That would kind of be all encompassing. The fountain turning on indicating the change of the season is the symbol of internal change in Dan. One thing Dan constantly writes about is struggling with societal expectations vs where he is in life and if it meets or fails those expectations. Liking lucky charms and soy milk without being a vegan is simply another piece of evidence of this change in Dan and his acceptance that it’s ok. Societal expectation is that you only drink soy milk if you’re vegan or some kind of health aficionado. Dan saying that he just prefers the taste is more like putting a foot down and saying “I don’t give a fuck what the expectation is. I like it. It’s that simple. Who gives a fuck what any other thought on the matter is?” He even reiterates this struggle years later in Lead Paint &amp; Salt Air from Routine Maintenance. “Why can’t I just like it.”",1567344549,2,TheWonderYearsMusic

Bouck,"I agree and disagree with you all at the same time.

The part I agree with is the crickets part. It always fucking baffles me how much anxiety people have about telling someone “No, thank you.” People will lie, avoid, make excuses, ghost, etc. all in an effort to avoid simply saying “No thanks.” This is a universal and fundamental issue of all parts of life that has always pissed me off. People would rather hear “no” than get strung along or, worse, be lied to.

Where I disagree with you is the knowing the value of something and knowing a “fair” price. I know that some things are more universally standard. But I VC a significantly lesser known band and it always pisses me off what people ask for certain items. Not because it’s out of my price range... wife knows I’ve paid several hundred dollars for certain items that I wanted. The issue is whether an item actually is of the crazy value set. I frequently see 7” records from this band be listed for $300+ when their dramatically rarer and individually personalized test pressings of their most successful album has sold at least 10 times in the last 6 years at less than $150. Somehow bullshit value gets tacked on to things that it absolutely isn’t worth and people are just out of their fucking minds ask what they ask. I know this may seem like splitting hairs, but there were two 7” EPs I have had my eye on for quite awhile. They periodically sell for $60. I’ve refused to pay that. They aren’t worth $60. I recently picked up both for $10 a piece in fantastic shape, graded NM-, PayPal buyer protection, and the releases were of the level graded. IMHO they are worth about $15, not $60. Popsike and Discogs can say $60 all day, but they just aren’t worth it.

All of that is to say that whether it’s quadruple or double digit items, what may seem reasonable to one may not be realistic to another. But again, the seeker needs to pull their head out of their ass and at least communicate their interest or lack thereof.",1567788551,3,VinylCollectors

dortega209,"I just went yesterday to see the Jets game. Getting to the stadium, your best bet is taking the NJ Transit. Steps are below:
 
1. Get to Penn Station. First you need to take NY’s transit system (MTA) to Penn Station. You can take the 1/2/3 or the A/C/E there. You can also cab or walk depending how close you are. 
 
2. Exit the MTA side and walk through the terminal to find NJ transit. As you enter that area, you can buy tickets on the left side and wait for the trains on the right side. A round trip train ticket should be $11 per person. Note: I tried to get the stadium very early, but the first train left at 11am. Keep that in mind. 
 
3. Look at the schedule for the next train. You are only going one stop to Secaucus, and virtually every NJ transit train stops there first. Find the platform number and wait there.
 
4. Get off the train after one stop (Secaucus). Honestly, just follow all the fans to wherever they go. There are tons of attendants who you can ask where to go for the Meadowlands. It’s just one stop from Secaucus. You will have to scan your ticket here to get to the Meadowlands train.

3. Offensive line was great. Way better than past seasons.
 
4. The offense looked scary that first drive. That is what I envisioned for this team. Give Saquon the ball on 50% of every drive. I'm not kidding. He will score if he gets the chance.
 
5. Engram looked great. Latimer has potential as WR2. Shep looked pretty good too. I like the WR corps.
 
5. Eli played well aside, the playcalling was just shit. If Dallas just ran 4 man pressure all game, why didn't the Giants run more?? The offensive line showed they can block, give Saquon the rock and don't be afraid to run if you get stuffed on first down.

This Alabama team is very good. Jeudy and Ruggs are seeing a lot of success with Tua. But you can’t expect the same success against what literally would be the best college team in the NCAA. Xavien Howard and Kenyan Drake are above average NFL players. Josh Rosen has just as much potential as Tua, but will be behind a real NFL line. And even though the Dolphins are fielding no-name defensive lineman, they still manage to get pressure occasionally against other NFL lines. Imagine what they would do against a college offensive line. The weakest offensive lineman on Alabama would simply be destroyed every snap.
 
And finally, the area where I know the NFL players will ABSOLUTELY win every time, is Special Teams. Oh my god. The top 254 players are drafted every year, with a bunch of undrafteds making the team.

dortega209,"Saquon is easily worth 10% of the cap, which would be about $22 million when he is up for a contract. He will probably get something around $18-20 million per year. Easy decision to pay the man if he keeps his production up.",1567600743,50,nfl
dortega209,"Exactly. Also, the Jets didn't magically become some super team after drafting Darnold. He didn't have the implied impact that the tweet is saying.",1568643381,65,nfl
dortega209,And sadly we ran Saquon 11 times. 3 rushes were on the 1st drive.,1568146144,38,NYGiants
dortega209,I mean...who else would get the ball? Shepard and Engram need to step it up to help Barkley from wearing down.,1567810768,5,nfl
dortega209,"He will have Shepard back this week. So Shep, Engram, and Barkley, with a good o-lime, is a great supporting cast. Plus, he will get Tate in 2 weeks. 
 
2 weeks won’t break him. Tampa and Washington don’t have top tier defensive lines (or defenses in general). Let him play.",1568730542,1,NYGiants
dortega209,Oh right. Well then nvm lol,1568327490,1,nfl
dortega209,I did some research and Croxley’s looks good. Do you know if they play game sound? Same for Rattle and Hum?,1569691493,2,NYGiants
dortega209,Definitely,1567879960,1,nfl
dortega209,"Exactly this. Jones showed he has the potential and the skill to be a top QB in the league. He made amazing throws, performed well under pressure, and used his legs sparingly but smartly. 
 
He really needs to work on the fumbles and awareness of pressure. Some plays he felt it and moved up or around the pocket to make great throws. Other plays he had no idea hits were coming and got sloppy with the ball. 
 
Luckily most rookies struggle with this, hopefully he can correct those mistakes. Looks like he has strong accuracy, goes through his reads, and doesn’t get phased by pressure. Excellent traits for a young QB, those were all things critics were concerned about with him coming out of Duke.",1569240971,13,nfl
dortega209,"Honestly, I wouldn’t be made if we ran Saquon 3 times in a row and went 3 and out. He is the team’s best opportunity to score BY FAR. If he gets stuffed on 1st and 2nd down, maybe throw it, but I can’t get upset at over utilizing him. But the 1st and 2nd downs in drives 2,3 and 4 where we didn’t run Saquon were inexcusable. He needs the ball on 1st or 2nd down EVERY DRIVE in the first 3 quarters, and the 4th quarter if it’s a one score game. No excuses.",1568062989,6,NYGiants
dortega209,Definitely. They should at least share the role. Ease Love into the FS position.,1568063537,3,NYGiants
dortega209,"The offense has the pieces to function. See the 1st drive of the game. What is frustrating is the misuse of Saquon. The offense SHOULD be better than it was.
 
For the defense, they are frustrating because of lack of talent and experience. I can't fault anyone for that except Jerry Reese. It will take time, reps, and continuation of drafting solid players to fix the defense.",1568149446,6,NYGiants
dortega209,"I think we need to hit on a good late round draft pick. We seem to draft solid, decent, or mediocre players in round 3 and beyond. BJ Hill has the best chance to be a superstar. The Giants need one or more of Carter, Beal, Love, and Ximenes to develop into a solid starter. They show great potential, but at the end of the day most young NFL players have potential. It’s all about production.",1567867635,3,nfl
dortega209,"My friends did it for the Jets game, they said it was actually pretty seamless. 
 
You can look up Redd’s restaurant, which is about 1 mile away and does park/shuttle for $30, a little cheaper.",1569685687,7,NYGiants
dortega209,They all lose,1569502359,1,nfl
dortega209,"So they just moved $5 million of his cap hit into 2020 and 2021. Not bad but don’t want to make that a habit, that’s how you end up in cap he’ll again. I get it for this year though, makes sense.",1567867750,10,NYGiants
dortega209,"Definitely agree that the NBA situation is tricky, especially given that a starting 5 can have multiple max contracts. But for the NFL, capping a player at 20% of the cap this year would be AAV of $37.64 million, which no player is making. No team would even dream of having 2 max players given roster sizes. So it would stifle the insane growth of QB contracts to match the salary cap, vs this new trend of ""make any decent QB the highest paid when his contract is up"".
 
It is a tricky situation but I think money should be more evenly distributed across to the superstars of other positions. Yes, QB is the most important, and it will still be the highest paid by far, but the salaries need a little bit of leveling.",1569508995,3,nfl
dortega209,"Not yet. It was one game. Rookie CB’s often struggle in their first year. Not to mention, Betcher left Baker with one-on-one coverage due to multiple blitzes (because a 4 man rush was pathetic). Even the blitzes brought no pressure. 
 
I’d like Baker to get the reps now. Ballentine does need to take the CB3 spot though. Hamilton is an absolute joke and shouldn’t even sniff CB5, but we need him because we have no depth. 
 
I’d like to see Julian Love get more playing time too, even though I fear he will struggle like Baker did. Let the young guys play and get baptized by fire.",1568062779,21,NYGiants
dortega209,"Was at the game. Kept an eye on Baker for a lot of plays. Bettcher learned that he can leave Baker in 1 on 1 coverage against the #2 receiver pretty often. He struggles heavily in zone. He guarded his man very well, but keep in mind the WR #2 today was the WR #3 with Terry out for the game. The Redskins have no playmakers at WR #2 or #3. 
 
But still good job doing what he was asked to do. The kid is talented, he just needs the reps. Keeping expectations low for year 1.",1569795452,14,NYGiants

dortega209,"You can read my drive by drive analysis, shows the score as the drive started to give some perspective on his usage throughout the game. I also put in all his rushes and targets to get a better story than “the Giants ran 4 offensive plays in the 2nd quarter” narrative that’s going around.",1568167587,1,nfl

He is clearly very very good and it takes a lot of respectable hard work and talent to get where he is, and beat who he has beaten but I personally believe his record and performances and accolades put him below Henderson, Anderson, Wanderlei, Weidman, Machida (at all weights not just MW), Bisping, Jacare, Romero, Rockhold, Whittaker, Rich Franklin.

Jon Jones is a nice guy if you associate nice guy with being well mannered, professional and generally respectful, which he is outside of his Cormier rivalry. However you also have to discount the various risking of other peoples' lives in his vehicle, checkered past and starting brawls at press conferences (full blame to he and DC both. I like DC but as soon as JBJ enters the room he becomes intolerable). 

McGregor is widely regarded as a great guy, he paid off every debt his family had, literally the first thing he did after he beat Mendes according to one of the embedded his father was on. He also has a great reputation with fans. Doesn't change the fact that he is clearly out of control and violent towards others at times.

Most people are generally socially adjusted, well mannered and taught well enough to behave well in public, that doesn't excuse standing by a rapist like Lloyd Irvin.

It would certainly make a for a more civil and fair field of debate. No one purposely allows their preteen child to hurt themselves with a firearm. So perhaps Beto, and the country should discuss reasonable grounds for confiscation, as well as other means of gun safety, or a form of grandfathering in for current gun owners without any issue so far. I agree with your and the other posters overall sentiment about frightful ownership however. We have to think reasonably, but also within the confines of the second amendment and our principles, both modern and founding.

You or I likely cannot privately own a rocket launcher. This to most people seems fair because we see it has no purpose other than sudden mass murder of other people, and you have other reasonable means to defend yourself. There really isn't an argument against the statement ""an automatic, or semi automatic rifle, can be used dangerously against innocent people in a mass attack"". So from there we lay out guidelines as to what level of threat a person could have potential for, and to what degree we can moderate it and regulate it so that they have the smallest window of opportunity to hurt others, maliciously or accidentally. Then evaluate those regulations and say ""okay so which of these are in line with our modern and founding principles regarding the second amendment, and supreme court precedent""?

Personally I don't think automatic rifles do, on semi, I'm a bit less inclined but still believe more can be done to protect our population from attacks that are prevented and/or far less prevalent in many other nations, while preserving our freedoms within the same reason they are preserved whenever we roll out new laws and rules.

Pm-me-gift-cardz,"Is it really NS who did that? 

I think the OP is pretty. Clearly fishing for an NN to say the president made a mistake, and doubled down on it because he is stubborn and otherwise incompetent.

Pm-me-gift-cardz,"Theres a difference between this and trickery, or randomly attacking in a break a la Mayweather. That was legal but unsportsmanlike. Bisping has no right to call a break in the action, especially when he is on the back foot and Anderson is looking for openings. Completely unfair to say Anderson should risk his opportunities to allow a fighter to initiate an unsanctioned break.",1568918044,2,MMA

Had he beaten Munoz everyone would have said that's exactly what Pedro was.

Aljo, Edgar, CeJudo, Cruz (my personal pick for Cody), Moraes, Munoz, Rivera are all in that division and I'm sure more. There is no reasonable low level fight for Cody that is both; easy enough to win as you describe, and sensible based on the rankings.",1569016016,9,MMA
